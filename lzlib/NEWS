Changes in version 1.7:

The fast encoder, which produces a compression speed and ratio
comparable to those of gzip, has been ported from lzip.

The option "-0" has been ported from lzip to minilzip.

If all the data to be compressed are written in advance, lzlib will
automatically adjust the header of the compressed data to use the
smallest possible dictionary size. This feature reduces the amount of
memory needed for decompression and allows minilzip to produce identical
compressed output as lzip.

The targets "install-compress", "install-strip-compress",
"install-info-compress" and "install-man-compress" have been added to
the Makefile.
